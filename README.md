# Heart-Disease-Analysis
  Analyze the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to find patterns in risk factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age Aim: Understand how different factors contribute to heart disease risk using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Dataset: UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset (Kaggle)

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

///////////////////////////////////

Project Plan: Heart Disease Risk Analysis
1. Data Collection
Download the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle.

Load it using Pandas.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

Convert categorical variables if necessary (e.g., sex, chest pain type).

Identify outliers using box plots.

Normalize/standardize numerical data if needed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

Visualizations:

Histogram of age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.

Correlation heatmap using Seaborn.

Box plots for cholesterol and blood pressure by heart disease presence.

Pairplot to see relationships between numerical variables.

Count plots for categorical variables.

4. Key Insights
Which factors show the strongest correlation with heart disease?

Does cholesterol or blood pressure play a bigger role?

Are there noticeable trends by age or gender?

5. Report & Conclusion
Summarize findings with key takeaways.

Provide possible recommendations based on the analysis.
